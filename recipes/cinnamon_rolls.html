		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>This cinnamon roll recipe makes classic, home-style cinnamon rolls. They’re fluffy, soft, and topped with vanilla glaze. It’s taken me some time to develop quick cinnamon rolls that maintain all the flavor of traditional overnight cinnamon rolls. I have the winner for you right here and I baked two batches just to be sure.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Milk</li>
			<li>sugar</li>
			<li>yeast</li>
			<li>butter</li>
			<li>egg</li>
			<li>flour</li>
			<li>cinnamon</li>
			<li>salt</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Generously butter two disposable foil pie/cake pans.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the warm mixture and let set for 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Add 4 cups (500g) of all-purpose flour to the milk mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until just combined.</li>
			<li>Knead the dough lightly, adding additional flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface.
Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. Fix corners to make sure they are sharp and even.
Spread the softened butter evenly over the dough.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar and a generous sprinkling of cinnamon.
Press the mixture into the butter.
Roll up the dough, forming a log, and pinch the seam closed. Place seam-side down. Trim off any unevenness on either end.
Cut the log in half, then divide each half into 7 evenly sized pieces. About 1½ inches (8cm) thick each.
Place 7 cinnamon rolls in each cake pan, one in the center, six around the sides. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>VPreheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
To prepare the frosting. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together cream cheese, butter, whole milk, vanilla, and powdered sugar, until smooth.
Remove plastic wrap. Bake the cinnamon rolls in a preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.
While still warm, drizzle evenly with frosting.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
