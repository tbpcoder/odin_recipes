		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>As its name implies, this American Sponge Cake has a spongy texture that is wonderfully light and moist. It has a sweet citrus flavor and since it does not contain solid fat, it is the ideal cake for those watching their fat intake. This cake can be eaten plain, with just a dusting of powdered sugar. But my favorite way is to use it to make Strawberry Shortcake. Just cut the cake in half and fill it with lightly sweetened strawberries and lots of whipped cream. </p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>softened butter</li>
			<li>golden caster sugar</li>
			<li>eggs</li>
			<li>lemon</li>
			<li>vanilla extract</li>
			<li>flour</li>
			<li>milk</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, butter and line the base of two 20cm spring-form cake tins with baking parchment.</li>
			<li>Using an electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Crack the eggs in one at a time and whisk well, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the lemon zest, vanilla, flour, milk and a pinch of salt. Whisk until just combined then divide the mixture between the two tins.</li>
			<li>Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. After 10 mins remove the cakes from their tins and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Fill how you like. My personal favourite is a good dollop of lemon curd and some fresh cream, then dust the top with icing sugar. Will keep for 3 days.</li>
